Instagram Comment Classifier
This is a machine learning project that aims to classify Instagram comments as positive or negative. The goal is to study the influence of negative comments on the popularity of a post.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets in English labeled as positive or negative.

Preprocessing
The following preprocessing techniques were applied to the comments before training the model:

Noise suppression
Tokenization
Stop word removal
Stemming and Lemmatization
Handling contractions

The classification models were XXXX

Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the performance of the model.

Future Work
Improve the model's performance by experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
Extend the model to classify comments in other languages.
Explore the impact of different types of negative comments on the popularity of a post.
